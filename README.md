# License Plate Recognition using YOLOv11 + OCR

This project implements a complete **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using **YOLOv11** for license plate detection and **OCR (EasyOCR)** for character recognition.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- âœ… YOLOv11 object detection for accurate license plate localization
- âœ… Python-based pipeline using Ultralytics YOLO API
- âœ… Integrated OCR for real-time character recognition (EasyOCR)
- âœ… Handles low-light, rotated, or blurry plates
- âœ… Evaluation metrics: mAP@0.5, precision, recall, F1-score
- âœ… All model weights, data samples, and results organized
- âœ… Compatible with both image and video inputs
